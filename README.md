# Bamazon

Description: An Amazon-like storefront using MySQL as the database, and node as the app interface. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

1. The app will first display product information.

2. You will then be able to select a certain product by ID. 

3. After choosing a product, the app will then ask for the quantity you would like.

4. The app will then calculate and display your total cost. If the quantity you requested is more than what is available, then you will get a notification of "insufficient quantity."
